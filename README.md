### Assignment

Use a decision tree model to predict customer churn (the percentage of customers that stopped using a companyâ€™s product or service during a certain time frame).

- Split your data into train and test sets.
- Get basic descriptive statistics for the training data and check for missing and incorrect or extreme values. Get scatterplots or heatmaps showing the relationship between the variables.
- What are the factors that predict user churn?
- Report the accuracy of your model on the training set and on the test set. How successful is the model - what is its sensitivity and specificity?
- What is the churn prevalence? How might prevalence affect the positive and negative predictive values of a test/model?
